# organize related modules inside a package
# a package is a cointainer for multiple modules
# it is a directory or folder
# in the ecommerce package will have modules for sales, shipping, customer service etc
# in order to convert an empty directory to a package, we need to add a special file in it. add a __init__.py  to the package folder
# when the python interpreter sees a folder with __init__.py it treats it as a package
